the  "2025-02-04 Tue 13-36.csv" has 10,000 samples of tau when initial is N(0, 50^2)

tv est 2025-02-04 Tue 13-36.csv 
has a sample of 10K when chains start points are initialised
by N(0,50^2) 

tv est 2025-02-05 Wed 18-46.csv 
is also a sample of 10K but chains are initialised
by N(0, 100^2) - this is more interesting when compared to the previous. Tau obviously has higher sample variance 
- the number of steps before the chains meet (tua-lag) has mean ~200 and std error ~150, 
This and as seen from the boxplots the IQR is very close to 300 implying that the unlagged chain may not even have 
reached stationarity before coupling. This explains the quite vacous bound on the TV distance given by the lag 300 sample.
Also the bound was not effectively zero by 500 iterations for any lag either-whereas it was for the previous set up before.
